axolotl
=======

Minimum and efficient documentation system.   
See [Description](https://github.com/circulosmeos/axolotl/).

Installation
============

Here are the configuration files for keybindings (**Alt+1** to **Alt+9**) and color highlighting for text files edited with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

For key bindings, copy the file `keybindings.json` to:

* On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Code\User`

* on Mac/Linux: `$HOME/AppData/Roaming/Code/User`

If there's a previous `keybindings.json`, just copy the contents of this file between the comments for `Axolotl` in your own `keybindings.json` file to not delete the already-defined key bindings.

For text highlighting, copy the extension folder `axolotl.documentation-1.0.0` to the extension directory. This is:

* on Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`

* on Mac/Linux: `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`

and restart Code: now all files with `.txt` extension will be highlighted as Axolotl documents.
