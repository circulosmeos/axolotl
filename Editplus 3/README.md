Minimum and efficient documentation system.   
See [Description](https://github.com/circulosmeos/axolotl/).

Installation
===========

Here are the configuration files for keybindings (alt+1 to alt+8) and color highlighting for text files edited with [Editplus 3](https://www.editplus.com/). *Note: tested with Editplus v3.01*.   
Make a backup first if you wish!: some files may be overwritten.

Close Editplus 3 now!

Copy these files to the Editplus user directory:   
* *default0_mac*
* *default2_mac*
* *default3_mac*
* *default4_mac*
* *default5_mac*
* *default6_mac*
* *default7_mac*
* *editplus_u.ini*
* *setting_u.ini*
* *text.stx*

Now, in order to create a keybinding for "Alt+2" which will print actual date and (your) user name as axolotl's tags:
Type in any Editplus opened document, carefully and in this exact order the next (in bolds are special combination of keys):
* **Ctrl+Q** *(this starts the key recording)*
* Choose *Alt+2* from the list
* [[**Ctrl+D**]] [[
* *type the* USER_NAME *you want to write in your doc tags: it'll identify your annotations*
* ]] *(with a final blank space so next tags can be easily added at the end with an Alt+6)*
* **Ctrl+Q** *(this will end the key recording: Done!)*

Start Editplus 3 and open or create some .txt file:   
now you can check your Alt+ 1 to 8 new key bindings and highlights.

### Windows paths:
* Editplus 3 user directory:   
	**C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Editplus 3**
